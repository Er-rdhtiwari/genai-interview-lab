# Tyoes Of statistics
- Descriptive statistics
- Infrential statistics
# Definition of Basic terms
    - Sample
    - Vatiable
    - Data (Singular)
    - Data (Plural)
    - Random variable
    - Experiment
    - parameter
    - Statictics


# Types of data
    - Numerical
        - Countinuous
        - Discrete
    - Categorical
        - Ordinal
        - Nominal

# Steps involve in Descriptive Sattistics
    - Collecting the data
    - Presenting the data
    - Summarizing the data 

# Making sense of Data
    - With replacement
    - Without replacement

# Collecting the data
- Define the Objective
- Define the varribale and population of interest
- Define data collection scheme and datamesuring scheme
- Define the appropriate descriptive and infrential analysis techniques

# Method to use collect data
- Experiment
- Surevey
- Census
- Judgment samples
- Probability Samples

# Types of Sampling
    - Probability Sampling
        - simple random Sampling
        - startified Sampling
        - systematic Sampling
        - cluster random Sampling
        - multistaged random Sampling
    - Non-probabilitysampling

# Sampling Error

# Exploratory Data analytics
    - Measure of Central tendency
        - Mean
        - Midean
        - Mode
    - Measure of Spread/Data variability
        - range
            -  How outliers impact range? what should the approach for it?
            -  InterQuartile range
            - Formula for Lower limit/Bound => 1.5*(IQR-Q1)
            - Formula for Upper limit/Bound => 1.5*(IQR+Q1)


## Data Analytics:-
Descriptive (What happened):
- Note: Summarizes past data using counts, totals, averages, and trends.
- Example: Website had 12,000 visits last month; average session time was 2.3 minutes.

Diagnostic (Why Happened)
- Note: Investigates causes and correlations via drill-downs, segmentation, and root-cause analysis.
- Example: Traffic dipped because organic search fell 30% after an SEO change.

Predictive (What  can happen in future)
- Note: Uses historical patterns to forecast outcomes with models like regression or time series.
- Example: Forecast 13,500 visits next month given seasonal uptick and planned ad spend.

Prescriptive (Suggestions)
- Note: Recommends actions to achieve a goal, sometimes optimizing under constraints.
- Example: Increase search ads by 15% and improve page load speed to recover traffic.

## Data scintist vs Data engineer vs data Analyst 
- Data Scientist: Builds statistical/ML models to answer what/why/what-if.
- Data Engineer: Designs and maintains data pipelines, storage, and platforms.
- Data Analyst: Explores data and creates dashboards, reports, and insights.
- Example: For churn reduction—engineer builds the churn dataset; scientist trains the churn model; analyst tracks churn KPI and builds the dashboard.

## Domain Analysys: 
- Note: Understand the business context, goals, processes, KPIs, and constraints before analysis/modeling.
- Steps: Identify stakeholders and problem, define KPIs and success criteria, map processes and data sources, note constraints (budget, SLA, compliance).
- Example: Retail domain—Goal: reduce returns by 10%. KPIs: return rate, cost. Data: orders, returns, product, customer support. Constraints: refund policy, logistics SLA.

## Data:
- Statistically -> type of data
       - Categorical
            - Ordinal -> has order -> 
            -   example: size -> small, medium, large     
            - Nominal -> no order -> 
            -   example: color -> red, blue, green
       - Numerical
            - Discrete -> countable -> 
            -   example: number of items
            - Continuous -> not countable -> 
            -   example: weight


## Type Casting/ Data Type conversion
### 2 Types in typecasting
-  Auto type casting
-  Forced type casting

## Python Operators
### 1. Arithmatic operators
- +: addition
- -: subtraction
- *: multiplication
- /: division
- %: modulus
- **: exponentiation
- //: floor division
### 2. Assignment operators
### 3. Comparison operators
- ==: equal to
- !=: not equal to
- >: greater than
- <: less than
- >=: greater than or equal to
- <=: less than or equal to
### 4. Logical operators
- and: returns True if both statements are true
- or: returns True if one of the statements is true
- not: returns False if the result is true
### 5. Membership operators
### 6. Identity operators
### 7. Bitwise operators
